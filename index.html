            "a large area of land covered with trees and plants, usually larger
            than a wood, or the trees and plants themselves"(Cambridge
            Dictionary).

              Trees are connected by mycorrhizal fungi networks, often called
              the wood wide web. Through this network, trees can share nutrients
              and even send “warnings” when pests are present.

              Tropical rainforests cover only about 6-7% of the Earth's surface,
              yet they are home to more than half of all terrestrial species.

              Dense vegetation absorbs and deflects sound, which is why forested
              areas are often significantly quieter than urban environments.

              A single large tree can release hundreds of liters of water into
              the atmosphere each day.
